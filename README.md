# Analyzing California Policing Data
The first exploration aims to use the goals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate whether the California policing data indicate that policing differs by community demographics, namely race and income level?

The second exploration aims to make inferences about California local government spending on law enforcement through bootstrapping and a hypothesis test. The analysis focuses on how much their total budgets local governments (i.e., cities and counties) spend on their law enforcement agencies (i.e., city police and county sheriff departments). The analysis uses a bootstrap to estimate this percentage for all California cities and counties, then uses an A/B test to decide whether this percentage differs by jurisdictionsâ€™ racial makeup.
